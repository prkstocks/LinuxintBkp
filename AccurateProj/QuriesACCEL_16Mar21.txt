Queries to ACCEL:

1. Need clarification on JIRA project access.
2. GitHub access and Project, branch details required to clone the code.
3. Need URL and login credentials to access the ACCEL application
4. A walkthrough is required to interpret the testcase formats and design. 
5. I understand that some area hits the real-time data like email, contact no., SSN, etc., will it be a problem? is there any data set for testing purpose?
